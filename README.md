This Project is demonstration of SOLID principles
1. Single Repository Principle:
    A Class have only relatable functions 
2. Open-Close Principle:
    Any Function which is required will be added/Implemented separately
3. Liskov Substitution Principle:
    Child must be substituted of parent
4. Interface Segregation Principle:
    Add specific method signature in interface, 
    Similar to Single Repository Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle:
    Can be achieved using Interface/Abstraction
